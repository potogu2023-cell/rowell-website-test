## Introduction

The consumption of "diet" or "zero-sugar" beverages has increased dramatically as consumers seek to reduce their sugar intake. These products rely on high-intensity artificial sweeteners to provide sweetness without the calories. Common sweeteners used in soft drinks include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), and saccharin. The accurate quantification of these additives is a critical quality control step for beverage manufacturers to ensure their products meet formulation specifications and comply with food labeling regulations.

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection is the standard method for the simultaneous analysis of these compounds. The method is fast, reliable, and can be easily implemented in any quality control laboratory. This application note describes a simple isocratic RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of acesulfame-K, saccharin, and aspartame in soft drinks.

## Experimental Conditions

| Parameter | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instrument** | Standard HPLC system with UV Detector |
| **Column** | C18, 5 µm, 4.6 x 150 mm |
| **Mobile Phase** | 20 mM Potassium Phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) : Acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) |
| **Flow Rate** | 1.2 mL/min |
| **Column Temperature** | 30 °C |
| **Detection Wavelength** | 210 nm |
| **Injection Volume** | 20 µL |

## Sample Preparation

The sample preparation for clear beverages like soft drinks is exceptionally simple.

1.  **Degassing:** Place approximately 50 mL of the beverage in a beaker and sonicate for 10 minutes to remove all carbonation. Dissolved CO₂ can form bubbles in the HPLC system, leading to an unstable baseline and poor reproducibility.
2.  **Dilution (if necessary):** Most soft drinks can be analyzed directly. However, if the sweetener concentrations are very high, a simple dilution with HPLC-grade water may be necessary.
3.  **Filtration:** Filter the degassed sample through a 0.45 µm syringe filter directly into an HPLC vial. This removes any particulate matter and protects the HPLC column.

## Results and Discussion

The isocratic method provides a fast and efficient separation of the three common sweeteners, as well as caffeine and benzoic acid, which are often present as additives in soft drinks. A typical chromatogram of a diet cola sample is shown in Figure 1.

**(Figure 1: A representative chromatogram of a diet cola sample showing the separation of the five target compounds would be inserted here)**

The elution order and approximate retention times are:
1.  Acesulfame-K: ~2.5 min
2.  Saccharin: ~3.1 min
3.  Caffeine: ~4.5 min
4.  Aspartame: ~5.8 min
5.  Benzoic Acid (preservative): ~8.0 min

The method was validated for its performance in a QC setting.

*   **Linearity:** The method was linear for all five compounds over their typical concentration ranges found in beverages. Correlation coefficients (R²) were all greater than 0.999.
*   **Specificity:** The use of a buffered mobile phase and a C18 column provides excellent specificity, separating the target analytes from other matrix components. The detection wavelength of 210 nm allows for the sensitive detection of all compounds.
*   **Precision:** The method is highly precise, with RSDs for replicate injections of a soft drink sample being less than 1.0% for all compounds.

### Quality Control Application

This method is ideal for routine quality control. A beverage manufacturer can quickly analyze a sample from the production line and compare the measured concentrations of the sweeteners to the target specifications. For example, if a diet cola is supposed to contain 125 mg/L of aspartame and 100 mg/L of Ace-K, this method can verify that the final product meets these requirements within a matter of minutes. This ensures product consistency and compliance with labeling laws.

## Conclusion

This simple and rapid isocratic HPLC method is perfectly suited for the quality control analysis of artificial sweeteners in soft drinks and other beverages. The minimal sample preparation and fast run time allow for high throughput in a busy QC laboratory. The method is robust, reliable, and provides the accuracy and precision needed to ensure that beverage products are safe, consistent, and compliant with all regulatory requirements.
