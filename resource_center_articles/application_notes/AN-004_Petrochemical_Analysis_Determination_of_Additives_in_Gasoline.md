## Introduction

Gasoline is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that is susceptible to oxidation during storage, leading to the formation of gums and deposits that can impair engine performance. To prevent this degradation, antioxidant additives are added to gasoline formulations. These additives, typically hindered phenols, inhibit the oxidation process and ensure fuel stability. Monitoring the concentration of these antioxidants is a critical quality control step in the petrochemical industry, ensuring that the fuel meets specifications and will remain stable over time.

This application note describes a normal-phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (NP-HPLC) method for the determination of two common phenolic antioxidants, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (BHT) and 2,4-dimethyl-6-tert-butylphenol, in gasoline samples. This method is relevant for refineries and fuel testing laboratories in regions like Russia and South America, where fuel quality standards are strictly enforced.

## Experimental Conditions

Normal-phase HPLC is preferred for this analysis because gasoline is a non-polar matrix. A direct injection of gasoline onto a reversed-phase column would cause the non-polar gasoline components to be strongly retained, fouling the column.

| Parameter | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instrument** | Standard HPLC system with UV Detector |
| **Column** | Silica, 5 µm, 4.6 x 250 mm |
| **Mobile Phase** | n-Hexane : Isopropanol (99:1, v/v) |
| **Flow Rate** | 1.5 mL/min |
| **Column Temperature** | Ambient (25 °C) |
| **Detection Wavelength** | 280 nm |
| **Injection Volume** | 20 µL |

## Sample Preparation

One of the major advantages of this normal-phase method is the minimal sample preparation required.

1.  Take a representative sample of the gasoline.
2.  Dilute the gasoline sample 1:10 with n-hexane.
3.  Filter the diluted sample through a 0.45 µm PTFE syringe filter directly into an HPLC vial.

This simple "dilute and shoot" approach is possible because the gasoline matrix itself acts as the solvent and is compatible with the normal-phase mobile phase.

## Results and Discussion

The NP-HPLC method provides a clean separation of the phenolic antioxidants from the bulk hydrocarbon matrix of the gasoline. The aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline are eluted first, near the solvent front, while the more polar phenolic antioxidants are retained and separated on the silica column. A typical chromatogram is shown in Figure 1.

Approximate retention times were:
*   Gasoline Matrix (Aromatics): < 3 min
*   2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (BHT): ~5.5 min
*   2,4-dimethyl-6-tert-butylphenol: ~6.8 min

The method was validated for its performance.

*   **Linearity:** The method was linear for both antioxidants over a concentration range of 1 to 100 mg/L, with correlation coefficients (R²) > 0.998.
*   **Specificity:** The baseline separation between the gasoline matrix and the antioxidant peaks demonstrates the high specificity of the method.
*   **Precision:** The precision was excellent, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 3% for replicate injections of a spiked gasoline sample.
*   **LOD/LOQ:** The Limits of Detection (LOD) were below 0.5 mg/L, which is more than sufficient for typical additive concentrations (usually in the range of 10-50 mg/L).

This method allows for the rapid and accurate quantification of antioxidant additives, enabling refineries to ensure their products meet quality specifications and to optimize the dosage of these important additives.

## Conclusion

This application note presents a simple, fast, and reliable normal-phase HPLC method for the determination of phenolic antioxidants in gasoline. The "dilute and shoot" sample preparation procedure makes it highly efficient for routine quality control analysis in a refinery or fuel testing laboratory. By using NP-HPLC, the complex hydrocarbon matrix of the gasoline does not interfere with the analysis, allowing for accurate and precise quantification of the polar antioxidant additives. This method is an essential tool for maintaining fuel quality and stability in the global petrochemical market.
