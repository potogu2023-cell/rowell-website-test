## Introduction

The widespread use of pesticides in modern agriculture has led to concerns about their residues in food products, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. Monitoring pesticide residues is essential to ensure food safety and protect public health. Regulatory bodies in many countries, including Pakistan and various nations in South America, have established Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a key technology for the sensitive and selective detection of these residues.

This application note presents a method for the simultaneous detection of three common pesticides (Carbofuran, Malathion, and Chlorpyrifos) in vegetable samples using a modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) sample preparation method followed by RP-HPLC with UV detection.

## Experimental Conditions

| Parameter | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instrument** | Standard HPLC system with UV Detector |
| **Column** | C18, 5 µm, 4.6 x 250 mm |
| **Mobile Phase** | Acetonitrile : Water (70:30, v/v) |
| **Flow Rate** | 1.2 mL/min |
| **Column Temperature** | 35 °C |
| **Detection Wavelength** | 220 nm |
| **Injection Volume** | 20 µL |

## Sample Preparation (QuEChERS Method)

The QuEChERS method is a streamlined sample preparation technique that simplifies the extraction and cleanup of pesticide residues from complex food matrices.

### 1. Extraction

1.  Homogenize 10 g of a representative vegetable sample (e.g., tomato, spinach) with 10 mL of acetonitrile in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
2.  Add the QuEChERS extraction salts (4 g MgSO₄, 1 g NaCl, 1 g sodium citrate, 0.5 g disodium citrate sesquihydrate).
3.  Shake vigorously for 1 minute and then centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes.

### 2. Dispersive Solid-Phase Extraction (d-SPE) Cleanup

1.  Transfer 6 mL of the upper acetonitrile layer to a 15 mL d-SPE tube containing 900 mg MgSO₄ and 150 mg of Primary Secondary Amine (PSA) sorbent.
2.  Shake for 30 seconds and then centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes.
3.  The PSA sorbent removes interferences such as organic acids, fatty acids, and sugars.

### 3. Final Solution

1.  Take 1 mL of the cleaned extract and evaporate it to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
2.  Reconstitute the residue in 1 mL of the mobile phase.
3.  Filter the solution through a 0.45 µm syringe filter before injecting it into the HPLC system.

## Results and Discussion

The developed HPLC method successfully separated the three pesticides with good resolution and symmetrical peak shapes. A typical chromatogram of a mixed standard solution is shown in Figure 1.

**(Figure 1: A representative chromatogram showing the separation of Carbofuran, Malathion, and Chlorpyrifos would be inserted here)**

Retention times were approximately:
*   Carbofuran: 4.2 min
*   Malathion: 5.8 min
*   Chlorpyrifos: 7.5 min

The method was validated for linearity, sensitivity (LOD and LOQ), and recovery.

*   **Linearity:** The method showed excellent linearity for all three pesticides in the range of 0.1 to 5.0 µg/mL, with correlation coefficients (R²) > 0.998.
*   **LOD and LOQ:** The Limits of Detection (LOD) were in the range of 0.02-0.05 µg/mL, and the Limits of Quantitation (LOQ) were 0.06-0.15 µg/mL, demonstrating the high sensitivity of the method.
*   **Recovery:** The method's accuracy was assessed by spiking blank vegetable samples at three different concentration levels (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 µg/g). The average recoveries were between 85% and 105%, with relative standard deviations (RSD) below 10%, which is acceptable for residue analysis.

This method was applied to analyze several vegetable samples collected from local markets. While most samples were found to be free of these pesticide residues or contained levels below the MRLs, one sample of spinach was found to have a Chlorpyrifos concentration slightly above the established limit, highlighting the importance of routine monitoring.

## Conclusion

This application note demonstrates an effective and reliable method for the determination of pesticide residues in vegetables using a QuEChERS sample preparation procedure followed by RP-HPLC-UV analysis. The method is sensitive, accurate, and provides good recovery rates, making it a valuable tool for food safety laboratories. The use of the QuEChERS method significantly reduces sample preparation time and solvent consumption, contributing to a more efficient and environmentally friendly workflow. This approach is well-suited for routine monitoring programs aimed at ensuring compliance with food safety regulations in regions where pesticide use is a concern.
