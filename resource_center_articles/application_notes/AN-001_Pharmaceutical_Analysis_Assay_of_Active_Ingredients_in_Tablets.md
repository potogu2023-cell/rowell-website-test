## Introduction

The accurate quantification of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in tablet formulations is a critical quality control step in the pharmaceutical industry. It ensures that each tablet contains the correct dosage, which is essential for drug safety and efficacy. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection is the most widely used technique for this purpose due to its high specificity, accuracy, and precision.

This application note describes a robust and reliable reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) method for the assay of a common API, Acetaminophen, in a commercial tablet formulation. This method is suitable for quality control laboratories in regions such as Pakistan, the Middle East, and Russia, where pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality assurance are of high importance.

## Experimental Conditions

| Parameter | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instrument** | Standard HPLC system with UV Detector |
| **Column** | C18, 5 µm, 4.6 x 150 mm |
| **Mobile Phase** | Methanol : Water (60:40, v/v) |
| **Flow Rate** | 1.0 mL/min |
| **Column Temperature** | 30 °C |
| **Detection Wavelength** | 243 nm |
| **Injection Volume** | 10 µL |

## Sample Preparation

### Standard Solution Preparation

1.  Accurately weigh about 100 mg of Acetaminophen reference standard and transfer it to a 100 mL volumetric flask.
2.  Add about 70 mL of mobile phase and sonicate for 10 minutes to dissolve.
3.  Dilute to volume with the mobile phase to obtain a standard solution of 1000 µg/mL.
4.  Further dilute this solution to obtain a working standard of 100 µg/mL.

### Sample Solution Preparation

1.  Weigh and finely powder 20 tablets to determine the average tablet weight.
2.  Accurately weigh a quantity of the powder equivalent to 100 mg of Acetaminophen and transfer it to a 100 mL volumetric flask.
3.  Add about 70 mL of mobile phase and sonicate for 15 minutes to ensure complete extraction of the API.
4.  Dilute to volume with the mobile phase and mix well.
5.  Filter the solution through a 0.45 µm syringe filter to remove any undissolved excipients.
6.  Dilute 10 mL of the filtered solution to 100 mL with the mobile phase to obtain a final concentration of approximately 100 µg/mL.

## Results and Discussion

Under the described chromatographic conditions, Acetaminophen was well-retained and eluted as a sharp, symmetrical peak. A typical chromatogram is shown in Figure 1.

The retention time for Acetaminophen was approximately 3.5 minutes, allowing for a rapid analysis time. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, and precision according to ICH guidelines.

*   **Specificity:** The chromatogram of the tablet formulation showed no interfering peaks from the excipients at the retention time of Acetaminophen, demonstrating the specificity of the method.
*   **Linearity:** The method was linear over a concentration range of 20-150 µg/mL, with a correlation coefficient (R²) of > 0.999.
*   **Accuracy:** The accuracy of the method was determined by recovery studies. The average recovery was found to be between 98.0% and 102.0%, which is within the acceptable limits for pharmaceutical assays.
*   **Precision:** The precision of the method was evaluated by analyzing six replicate injections of the sample solution. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 2.0%, indicating excellent precision.

### Calculation of API Content

The amount of Acetaminophen in the tablet was calculated using the following formula:

```
Assay (%) = (Area_sample / Area_standard) * (Conc_standard / Conc_sample) * (Avg_tablet_weight / Label_claim) * 100
```

The results from the analysis of a commercial tablet formulation showed that the API content was within 99.5% - 101.5% of the label claim, meeting the typical pharmacopeial requirements (e.g., 95.0% - 105.0%).

## Conclusion

This application note demonstrates a simple, rapid, and reliable RP-HPLC method for the quantitative determination of Acetaminophen in tablet dosage forms. The method is accurate, precise, and specific, making it suitable for routine quality control analysis in the pharmaceutical industry. The short run time allows for high throughput, which is essential in a busy QC environment. This method can be easily adapted for the assay of other APIs in similar tablet formulations, providing a valuable tool for ensuring the quality and safety of pharmaceutical products in global markets.
