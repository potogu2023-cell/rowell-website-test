## Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem, linked to a range of conditions including osteoporosis, rickets, and other metabolic bone diseases. The clinical assessment of a patient's vitamin D status is typically performed by measuring the concentration of its major circulating metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], in human serum. While immunoassays are widely used, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is considered the gold standard method because it can separately quantify the two major forms, 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (from sun exposure and diet) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂ (from supplements).

This application note details a reliable RP-HPLC method with UV detection for the quantification of 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ [25(OH)D₃] in human serum. This method is suitable for clinical diagnostic laboratories in various regions, including the UAE and other parts of the Middle East, where sunshine is abundant but deficiency can still be prevalent.

## Experimental Conditions

| Parameter | Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Instrument** | Standard HPLC system with UV Detector |
| **Column** | C18, 3.5 µm, 4.6 x 100 mm |
| **Mobile Phase** | Methanol : Water (90:10, v/v) |
| **Flow Rate** | 1.0 mL/min |
| **Column Temperature** | 40 °C |
| **Detection Wavelength** | 265 nm |
| **Injection Volume** | 100 µL |

## Sample Preparation

Serum is a complex matrix, requiring a multi-step sample preparation procedure to remove proteins and other interferences and to extract the fat-soluble vitamin D metabolites.

### 1. Protein Precipitation and Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE)

1.  To 500 µL of human serum in a glass tube, add 500 µL of acetonitrile to precipitate the proteins. Vortex for 30 seconds.
2.  Add 2 mL of n-hexane and vortex for 2 minutes to extract the 25(OH)D₃ into the organic layer.
3.  Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the layers.

### 2. Evaporation and Reconstitution

1.  Carefully transfer the upper hexane layer to a clean tube.
2.  Evaporate the hexane to dryness under a stream of nitrogen at 40 °C.
3.  Reconstitute the dried residue in 200 µL of the mobile phase (Methanol:Water 90:10).
4.  Vortex for 30 seconds to ensure the residue is fully dissolved.
5.  The sample is now ready for injection.

## Results and Discussion

The HPLC method provides a clean chromatogram with a well-resolved peak for 25(OH)D₃. The use of a C18 column and a highly organic mobile phase ensures good retention and peak shape for this non-polar analyte.

The retention time for 25(OH)D₃ was approximately 8.5 minutes. The method was validated for use in a clinical setting.

*   **Linearity:** The assay was linear across a clinically relevant range of 10 to 150 ng/mL, with a correlation coefficient (R²) of > 0.997.
*   **Sensitivity:** The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) was determined to be approximately 5 ng/mL, which is sufficient to diagnose vitamin D deficiency (typically defined as < 20 ng/mL).
*   **Accuracy and Precision:** Inter- and intra-assay precision were evaluated using quality control samples at low, medium, and high concentrations. The coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 10% in all cases, demonstrating excellent reproducibility. Accuracy, assessed by recovery studies, was within 90-110%.

### Clinical Interpretation

The concentration of 25(OH)D in the patient's serum is calculated by comparing the peak area to that of a calibrator of known concentration. The results are typically interpreted as follows:

| Status | Concentration (ng/mL) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deficiency** | < 20 |
| **Insufficiency** | 20 - 29 |
| **Sufficiency** | 30 - 100 |
| **Potential Toxicity** | > 100 |

## Conclusion

This HPLC-UV method provides a reliable and accurate means of quantifying 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ in human serum. While requiring a more involved sample preparation than automated immunoassays, it offers the significant advantage of being a direct measurement technique, free from the antibody cross-reactivity issues that can affect immunoassays. This makes it a robust and dependable choice for clinical laboratories providing diagnostic services for vitamin D status assessment, helping clinicians make informed decisions about patient care and supplementation.
