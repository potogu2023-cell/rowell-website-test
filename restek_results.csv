REST-9314262,9314262,Restek,"Raptor ARC-18, 1.8 µm, 150 x 2.1 mm HPLC Column",https://www.restek.com/p/9314262,"Description
Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
Designed and intended specifically for use on LC-MS/MS systems, the Raptor ARC-18 column offers a well-balanced retention profile without the drawbacks of using an ordinary C18 in the harsh, acidic mobile phases needed for mass spectrometry (MS). Even after extended use in these low-pH (≤ 2.0) conditions, the sterically protected ARC-18 offers consistent retention, peak shape, and response for charged bases, neutral acids, small polar compounds, and more. For the rapid analysis of large, multiclass assays by LC-MS/MS, the acid-resistant Raptor ARC-18 column truly is ahead of the curve.

This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
Analyzing polar compounds using liquid chromatography has historically been a challenge due to poor retention, long equilibration times, low sensitivity, and the need to mitigate these problems with time-consuming sample derivatization or complex ion-pairing approaches. However, with the development of the Raptor Polar X column—a novel column that is specifically designed for the analysis of a broad range of polar compounds—scientists can avoid these problems. These new columns feature a unique phase chemistry that combines both HILIC and ion-exchange retention mechanisms on a single ligand. Because this ligand is bound to superficially porous particles, Raptor Polar X columns both reliably retain and efficiently separate a wide variety of polar analytes with simple mobile phase changes. By analyzing polar compounds on a column that provides purpose-built resolving power, you can avoid complex sample preparation procedures, save time and money, and reduce opportunities for error. Simplify the analysis of polar compounds with the resolving power of Raptor Polar X columns from Restek.
The Raptor Polar X column has been included in the Quick Polar Pesticides (QuPPe) compendium of methods published by the European Union Research Laboratory for Single Residue Methods (EURL-SRM) for the analysis of a variety of polar pesticides in food [1].

The culmination of 20+ years in LC, Force performance LC columns are long-lasting and reproducible, even under the stress of UHPLC. Premium quality is backed by the strength of our 100% Pure Satisfaction guarantee. And perhaps most important, Force columns are fully scalable between 3 or 5 µm HPLC and 1.8 µm UHPLC, so you can easily transfer and optimize methods without extensive calculations. Apply Force LC columns to all of your HPLC and UHPLC instrument platforms.
The innovative Biphenyl is Restek's most popular LC stationary phase because it is particularly adept at separating compounds that are hard to resolve or that elute early on C18 and other phenyl chemistries. As a result, Biphenyl columns are extremely useful for bioanalytical testing applications like drug and metabolite analyses, especially those that require a mass spectrometer (MS). Increasing retention of early-eluting compounds can limit ionization suppression, and the heightened selectivity helps eliminate the need for complex mobile phases that are not well-suited for MS detection.

Per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of widely used industrial compounds that resist degradation and have become ubiquitous in the environment and in human samples from around the world. Because of their inertness, PFAS are used in tubing and other liquid-contacting parts of an HPLC system where they can leach into the mobile phase and interfere with sample analysis. This contamination is particularly problematic when analyzing at trace levels, such as at the ppt health advisory levels for drinking water. With many labs analyzing at single-digit ppt levels and striving for sub-ppt level detection, PFAS contamination from HPLC components can prevent accurate identification and quantitation of PFAS in samples. To eliminate this issue, Restek’s new PFAS delay column traps and ""delays"" system-related PFAS, preventing them from interfering with sample analysis. This delay column is a universal solution that can be used with any type of HPLC or UHPLC system up to 15,000 psi (1034 bar) and with any analytical column (fully porous or superficially porous).

Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
The innovative Biphenyl is Restek's most popular LC stationary phase because it is particularly adept at separating compounds that are hard to resolve or that elute early on C18 and other phenyl chemistries. As a result, the rugged Raptor Biphenyl column is extremely useful for fast separations in bioanalytical testing applications like drug and metabolite analyses, especially those that require a mass spectrometer (MS). Increasing retention of early-eluting compounds can limit ionization suppression, and the heightened selectivity helps eliminate the need for complex mobile phases that are not well suited for MS detection.

Analyzing polar compounds using liquid chromatography has historically been a challenge due to poor retention, long equilibration times, low sensitivity, and the need to mitigate these problems with time-consuming sample derivatization or complex ion-pairing approaches. However, with the development of the Raptor Polar X column—a novel column that is specifically designed for the analysis of a broad range of polar compounds—scientists can avoid these problems. These new columns feature a unique phase chemistry that combines both HILIC and ion-exchange retention mechanisms on a single ligand. Because this ligand is bound to superficially porous particles, Raptor Polar X columns both reliably retain and efficiently separate a wide variety of polar analytes with simple mobile phase changes. By analyzing polar compounds on a column that provides purpose-built resolving power, you can avoid complex sample preparation procedures, save time and money, and reduce opportunities for error. Simplify the analysis of polar compounds with the resolving power of Raptor Polar X columns from Restek.
The Raptor Polar X column has been included in the Quick Polar Pesticides (QuPPe) compendium of methods published by the European Union Research Laboratory for Single Residue Methods (EURL-SRM) for the analysis of a variety of polar pesticides in food [1].

This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
Analyzing polar compounds using liquid chromatography has historically been a challenge due to poor retention, long equilibration times, low sensitivity, and the need to mitigate these problems with time-consuming sample derivatization or complex ion-pairing approaches. However, with the development of the Raptor Polar X column—a novel column that is specifically designed for the analysis of a broad range of polar compounds—scientists can avoid these problems. These new columns feature a unique phase chemistry that combines both HILIC and ion-exchange retention mechanisms on a single ligand. Because this ligand is bound to superficially porous particles, Raptor Polar X columns both reliably retain and efficiently separate a wide variety of polar analytes with simple mobile phase changes. By analyzing polar compounds on a column that provides purpose-built resolving power, you can avoid complex sample preparation procedures, save time and money, and reduce opportunities for error. Simplify the analysis of polar compounds with the resolving power of Raptor Polar X columns from Restek.
The Raptor Polar X column has been included in the Quick Polar Pesticides (QuPPe) compendium of methods published by the European Union Research Laboratory for Single Residue Methods (EURL-SRM) for the analysis of a variety of polar pesticides in food [1].

This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
Analyzing polar compounds using liquid chromatography has historically been a challenge due to poor retention, long equilibration times, low sensitivity, and the need to mitigate these problems with time-consuming sample derivatization or complex ion-pairing approaches. However, with the development of the Raptor Polar X column—a novel column that is specifically designed for the analysis of a broad range of polar compounds—scientists can avoid these problems. These new columns feature a unique phase chemistry that combines both HILIC and ion-exchange retention mechanisms on a single ligand. Because this ligand is bound to superficially porous particles, Raptor Polar X columns both reliably retain and efficiently separate a wide variety of polar analytes with simple mobile phase changes. By analyzing polar compounds on a column that provides purpose-built resolving power, you can avoid complex sample preparation procedures, save time and money, and reduce opportunities for error. Simplify the analysis of polar compounds with the resolving power of Raptor Polar X columns from Restek.
The Raptor Polar X column has been included in the Quick Polar Pesticides (QuPPe) compendium of methods published by the European Union Research Laboratory for Single Residue Methods (EURL-SRM) for the analysis of a variety of polar pesticides in food [1].

Our new inert LC column technology helps labs improve their analysis of metal-sensitive compounds. A premium inert coating applied to the stainless-steel surface of our LC columns reduces nonspecific binding of chelating analytes, enabling sensitive analysis and smooth integration of peaks. Combined with Restek’s selective stationary phases, these new inert LC columns are ideal for the analysis of metal-sensitive compounds.
Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
Restek has now extended the speed and reliability of Raptor column technology into the HILIC realm with the addition of Raptor FluoroPhenyl columns. Restek's Raptor FluoroPhenyl phase offers chromatographers the ability to run in reversed-phase or HILIC mode for a variety of compounds. The Restek Raptor FluoroPhenyl column is also amenable to LC-MS because it is extremely reliable and efficient with acidic mobile phases.

Analyze oxygen, nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide with one column at room temperature. ShinCarbon ST material, a high surface area carbon molecular sieve (~1500 m2/g), is the ideal medium for separating gases and highly volatile compounds by gas solid chromatography (GSC). The rapid, above-ambient analyses these columns provide is a great convenience. Excellent thermal stability of the high surface area carbon, combined with careful conditioning during column manufacturing, ensures low-bleed operation and rapid stabilization when installing a new column. Custom-made ShinCarbon ST columns are available on request.
ShinCarbon ST is a highly stable material. Its 300 °C upper programmed temperature limit minimizes bleed and baseline rise during temperature programming, making the material compatible with most detection systems used for gas analysis, including TCD or HID. All ShinCarbon ST columns are fully conditioned in an oxygen/moisture-free environment for your convenience. This minimizes stabilization time (less than 30 minutes) when installing a new column which, in turn, reduces downtime.

Restek’s molecular sieve 5A PLOT columns are designed for efficient separation of argon/oxygen and other permanent gases, including carbon monoxide. Special coating and deactivation procedures ensure chromatographic efficiency and the integrity of the porous layer coating. Molecular sieves have very high retention, allowing separations of permanent gases at temperatures above ambient. Our deactivation technology also allows carbon monoxide to elute as a sharp peak. Additionally, our unique immobilization process guarantees that the uniform particles remain adhered to the tubing—even after continuous valve cycling.
Because molecular sieve materials are very hydrophilic, they will adsorb water from the sample or carrier gas. Water contamination can have a detrimental effect on peak symmetry and can reduce the resolution of all compounds. If water contamination occurs, reactivate your Restek Msieve 5A PLOT column by conditioning at 300 °C with dry carrier gas flow for 3 hours.

Porous polymers are unique, highly retentive stationary phases with a wide application range that are able to elute both polar and nonpolar compounds. They are very hydrophobic, so water has no impact on retention times and even elutes as a good chromatographic peak. The Q-BOND is our most nonpolar and widely used porous polymer column; functional groups can be added to increase polarity (i.e., QS-, S-, and U-BOND). The process used to manufacture porous polymer PLOT columns causes the particles to adhere strongly to the walls of the tubing, so there is virtually no particle generation. You get reproducible performance from column to column, including selectivity and flow.

We do not recommend recoiling PLOT columns as this may cause particles to dislodge from the side of the tubing.","{""19744"": ""Rt-Q-BOND PLOT Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 10 µm"", ""19764"": ""Rt-Q-BOND PLOT Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 8 µm"", ""19743"": ""Rt-Q-BOND PLOT Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 10 µm"", ""19765"": ""Rt-Q-BOND PLOT Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 8 µm"", ""19741"": ""Rt-Q-BOND PLOT Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 20 µm""}",

Restek’s polar-deactivated surface tightly binds the Carbowax polymer and increases thermal stability, relative to competitive columns. Because of the increased stability produced by the bonding process, Stabilwax columns exhibit long column lifetimes, even when programming repeatedly up to 260 °C. The bonding mechanism of the column also produces polar compound retention times that do not shift, as is often observed on other wax-type columns. In addition, this bonding mechanism produces a column that can be rejuvenated by solvent washing. Stabilwax columns are used for a wide range of compounds and matrices including FAMEs, flavor compounds, essential oils, solvents, aromatics (including xylene isomers), acrolein/acrylonitrile (EPA 603), and oxygenated compounds. Also used for purity testing of chemicals and analyzing alcoholic beverages.","{""10655"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10611"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10669"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""10609"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10627"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10623"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10605"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10652"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10666"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""10638"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10655-600"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm, 6-pk."", ""10621"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10610"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10636"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10608"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10641"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10642"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10654"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""43830"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 10 m, 0.15 mm ID, 0.15 µm"", ""10651"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10625"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10643"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""43831"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 20 m, 0.15 mm ID, 0.15 µm"", ""10635"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10667"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 2.00 µm"", ""10672"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""10657"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10637"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10622"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10623-600"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm, 6-pk."", ""10620"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10624"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10628"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""42601"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 10 m, 0.10 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10626"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""15102"": ""Stabilwax Secondary GC Capillary Column for GCxGC, 1.1 m (+ or - 3 cm), 0.10 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10639"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""40602"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 20 m, 0.18 mm ID, 0.18 µm"", ""10658"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10670"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 2.00 µm""}",

No leaks for a more robust method.
No column connections for easier, faster maintenance.
No peak distortions due to connector dead volume and thermal capacity.
For analysts who find it inconvenient to make a leak-free connection between the guard column and the analytical column, we offer Integra-Guard columns. These innovative columns incorporate both a guard column and an analytical column in a continuous length of tubing, eliminating the connection and all connection-associated problems! The guard column section is marked separately from the analytical column using high-temperature string.
A wide variety of our Integra-Guard capillary columns are listed here. The Integra-Guard column is so economical that we challenge you to compare our price against that of a conventional connection, even if you assemble it yourself. If you are currently using a guard column, or are considering using one, call today and ask about Integra-Guard columns.
If you don’t see what you need here, contact Customer Service.","{""13620-127"": ""Rxi-5Sil MS GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm with 10 m Integra-Guard Column"", ""10971-126"": ""Rtx-624

An Rtx-502.2 column will enable you to quantify all compounds listed in U.S. EPA methods 502.2 or 524.2, whether you use a mass spectrometer or a PID in tandem with an ELCD.

Restek’s polar-deactivated surface tightly binds the Carbowax polymer and increases thermal stability, relative to competitive columns. Because of the increased stability produced by the bonding process, Stabilwax columns exhibit long column lifetimes, even when programming repeatedly up to 260 °C. The bonding mechanism of the column also produces polar compound retention times that do not shift, as is often observed on other wax-type columns. In addition, this bonding mechanism produces a column that can be rejuvenated by solvent washing. Stabilwax columns are used for a wide range of compounds and matrices including FAMEs, flavor compounds, essential oils, solvents, aromatics (including xylene isomers), acrolein/acrylonitrile (EPA 603), and oxygenated compounds. Also used for purity testing of chemicals and analyzing alcoholic beverages.","{""10655"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10611"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10669"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""10609"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10627"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10623"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10605"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10652"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10666"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""10638"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10655-600"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm, 6-pk."", ""10621"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10610"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10636"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10608"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10642"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10654"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""43830"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 10 m, 0.15 mm ID, 0.15 µm"", ""10651"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10625"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10643"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""43831"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 20 m, 0.15 mm ID, 0.15 µm"", ""10635"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10667"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 2.00 µm"", ""10672"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""10657"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10637"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10622"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10623-600"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm, 6-pk."", ""10620"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10624"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""10628"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""42601"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 10 m, 0.10 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10626"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""15102"": ""Stabilwax Secondary GC Capillary Column for GCxGC, 1.1 m (+ or - 3 cm), 0.10 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""10639"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""40602"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 20 m, 0.18 mm ID, 0.18 µm"", ""10640"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""10658"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""10670"": ""Stabilwax GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 2.00 µm""}",

Stabilwax-DA bonded polyethylene glycol has an acidic functionality incorporated into the polymer structure. This permits analysis of acidic compounds without derivatization, significantly reduces adsorption of acids, and increases sample capacity for volatile free acids. Stabilwax-DA columns last longer and give better peak shapes for high molecular weight acids.
Some inorganic acids also chromatograph well on a Stabilwax-DA column; the limitation is the volatility of the acidic compound.
Stabilwax-DA columns should not be rinsed with water.","{""11037"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11005"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""11009"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""11054"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""11035"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11042"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11055"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""11022"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11026"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11062"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""11040"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11043"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11038"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11068"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""11024"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11025"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11007"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.10 µm"", ""11036"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11028"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11041"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11057"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""11065"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.50 µm"", ""11027"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11052"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""11039"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.50 µm"", ""11058"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 60 m, 0.53 mm ID, 1.00 µm"", ""11023"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11021"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 0.25 µm"", ""11020"": ""Stabilwax-DA GC Capillary Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm""}",

No leaks for a more robust method.
No column connections for easier, faster maintenance.
No peak distortions due to connector dead volume and thermal capacity.
For analysts who find it inconvenient to make a leak-free connection between the guard column and the analytical column, we offer Integra-Guard columns. These innovative columns incorporate both a guard column and an analytical column in a continuous length of tubing, eliminating the connection and all connection-associated problems! The guard column section is marked separately from the analytical column using high-temperature string.
A wide variety of our Integra-Guard capillary columns are listed here. The Integra-Guard column is so economical that we challenge you to compare our price against that of a conventional connection, even if you assemble it yourself. If you are currently using a guard column, or are considering using one, call today and ask about Integra-Guard columns.

Porous polymers are unique, highly retentive stationary phases with a wide application range that are able to elute both polar and nonpolar compounds. They are very hydrophobic, so water has no impact on retention times and even elutes as a good chromatographic peak. The Q-BOND is our most nonpolar and widely used porous polymer column; functional groups can be added to increase polarity (i.e., QS-, S-, and U-BOND). The process used to manufacture porous polymer PLOT columns causes the particles to adhere strongly to the walls of the tubing, so there is virtually no particle generation. You get reproducible performance from column to column, including selectivity and flow.

We do not recommend recoiling PLOT columns as this may cause particles to dislodge from the side of the tubing.","{""19771"": ""Rt-U-BOND PLOT Column, 15 m, 0.25 mm ID, 8 µm"", ""19749"": ""Rt-U-BOND PLOT Column, 15 m, 0.53 mm ID, 20 µm"", ""19750"": ""Rt-U-BOND PLOT Column, 30 m, 0.53 mm ID, 20 µm"", ""19772"": ""Rt-U-BOND PLOT Column, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 8 µm"", ""19751"": ""Rt-U-BOND PLOT Column, 15 m, 0.32 mm ID, 10 µm""}",

Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
To help protect your investment and further extend the life of our already-rugged LC columns, Restek offers the patent-pending guard column hardware developed by Optimize Technologies. A Restek LC guard cartridge in an EXP direct connect holder is the ultimate in column protection, especially when using dilute-and-shoot or other minimal sample preparation techniques.
Maximum cartridge pressure: 1034 bar/15,000 psi* (UHPLC); 600 bar/8700 psi (2.7 μm); 400 bar/5800 psi (5 μm).
* For maximum lifetime, recommended maximum pressure for UHPLC particles is 830 bar/12,000 psi.

Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
To help protect your investment and further extend the life of our already-rugged LC columns, Restek offers the patent-pending guard column hardware developed by Optimize Technologies. A Restek LC guard cartridge in an EXP direct connect holder is the ultimate in column protection, especially when using dilute-and-shoot or other minimal sample preparation techniques.
Maximum cartridge pressure: 1034 bar/15,000 psi* (UHPLC); 600 bar/8700 psi (2.7 μm); 400 bar/5800 psi (5 μm).
* For maximum lifetime, recommended maximum pressure for UHPLC particles is 830 bar/12,000 psi.

Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
To help protect your investment and further extend the life of our already-rugged LC columns, Restek offers the patent-pending guard column hardware developed by Optimize Technologies. A Restek LC guard cartridge in an EXP direct connect holder is the ultimate in column protection, especially when using dilute-and-shoot or other minimal sample preparation techniques.
Maximum cartridge pressure: 1034 bar/15,000 psi* (UHPLC); 600 bar/8700 psi (2.7 μm); 400 bar/5800 psi (5 μm).
* For maximum lifetime, recommended maximum pressure for UHPLC particles is 830 bar/12,000 psi.

Restek chemists became the first to combine the speed of superficially porous particles (also known as SPP or ""core-shell"" particles) with the resolution of highly selective USLC technology. This new breed of chromatographic column allows you to more easily achieve peak separation and faster analysis times with existing HPLC and UHPLC instrumentation.
To help protect your investment and further extend the life of our already-rugged LC columns, Restek offers the patent-pending guard column hardware developed by Optimize Technologies. A Restek LC guard cartridge in an EXP direct connect holder is the ultimate in column protection, especially when using dilute-and-shoot or other minimal sample preparation techniques.
Maximum cartridge pressure: 1034 bar/15,000 psi* (UHPLC); 600 bar/8700 psi (2.7 μm); 400 bar/5800 psi (5 μm).
* For maximum lifetime, recommended maximum pressure for UHPLC particles is 830 bar/12,000 psi.
